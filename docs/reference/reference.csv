Name of variables,Definition,Units
TIMESTAMP,Timestamp in UNIX standard,-
STATION,Abbbreviation of the SMN/Pluvio station (see 1),-
NX,"Indicates the neighbour of the pixel where there is the SMN/Pluvio in Swiss X-direction (from south to north), NX = -1: pixel in the south",-
NY,"Indicates the neighbour of the pixel where there is the SMN/Pluvio in Swiss Y-direction (from west to east),  NY = -1 pixel in the west, NX = 0 = NY corresponds to the location of the station",
